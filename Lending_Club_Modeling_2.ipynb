The highest efficiency on AUROC score has Logistic Regression with KFold validation, next is CatBoost with KFold and then there go SVM and Random Forest Classifier with KFold. The fifth is first model train without validation - AdaBooost Classifiers. Those 5 models I'm going to check with PCA method"
